\section{Hello World!}

\textbf{Hello World!} Today I am learning \LaTeX.
\LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as $a^2+b^2=c^2$
. I can also give equations their own space:
\begin{equation}
	\gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
\end{equation}

% \pagebreak

If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).
Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here $\downarrow$
\LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break.  Also   look  how      it   doesn't     matter          how    many  spaces     I put     between       my    words.

For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.
